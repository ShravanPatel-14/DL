# Deep Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various **TensorFlow-based deep learning models** applied to different datasets, including classification and regression tasks. Each project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various **TensorFlow-based deep learning models** applied to different datasets, including classification and regression tasks.

## Included Notebooks

1. **House Price Prediction (`tensorflow-neuralnetwork-houseprice.ipynb`)**
   - Uses a neural network to predict house prices based on multiple features.

2. **Superstore Sales Prediction (`Global_superstore_neural.ipynb`)**
   - Implements a neural network model to analyze and predict sales trends in the Global Superstore dataset.

3. **Multi-class Classification (`Tensorflow_multicls_classification.ipynb`)**
   - Trains a deep learning model to classify multiple categories using TensorFlow.

4. **Binary Classification (`Tensorflow_Binarycls_classification.ipynb`)**
   - Implements a binary classification neural network for distinguishing between two classes.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Preprocessing
Each notebook includes the following preprocessing steps:
- **Data Loading**: Load datasets using Pandas or TensorFlow utilities.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
- **Splitting Data**: Divide datasets into training and testing sets.
- **Data Augmentation (if applicable)**: Enhance dataset quality for better generalization.

## Validation
Each model is validated using the following techniques:
- **Train-Test Split**: Data is divided into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
- **Cross-Validation**: K-Fold cross-validation is used where applicable.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Models are assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and RMSE/MSE (for regression).
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss during training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search or random search is used to optimize model performance.

## How to Use
- Open the respective Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).
- Run each cell sequentially to execute data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Modify hyperparameters and architectures to experiment with different results.

## Expected Results
- **House Price Model:** Predicts house prices with neural networks.
- **Superstore Sales Model:** Analyzes sales patterns and future trends.
- **Multi-class & Binary Classification:** Classifies data accurately using deep learning models.
