# Fashion MNIST Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a deep learning classification model for the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images representing 10 different clothing categories. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a deep learning model to accurately classify these images.

## Dataset
- **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories.
- **Labels**:
  - 0: T-shirt/top
  - 1: Trouser
  - 2: Pullover
  - 3: Dress
  - 4: Coat
  - 5: Sandal
  - 6: Shirt
  - 7: Sneaker
  - 8: Bag
  - 9: Ankle boot

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## File Structure
- `FMNIST.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Loading**: Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalizes the image data for better model performance.
3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
4. **Training Process**:
   - Splits the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Uses batch training with backpropagation.
   - Monitors training loss and validation accuracy.
   - Applies early stopping or learning rate adjustments if necessary.
5. **Evaluation Process**:
   - Tests the model on unseen test data.
   - Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Generates a confusion matrix for class-wise performance analysis.
6. **Visualization**: Displays training progress and predictions.

## Usage
To run the notebook, open a terminal and execute:

```bash
jupyter notebook FMNIST.ipynb
```

## Results
- Model achieves an accuracy of ~XX% (update after execution).
- Performance metrics and confusion matrix included in the notebook.
